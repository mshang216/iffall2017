	<h1> Crit. notes for Tolu A. </h1>
		<ul>
			<li> Images are compelling! Your croppings are really nice too! </li>
			<li> I like that even though your desktop-mobile image sets are not necessarily all the same image, it's still obvious that they go together. </li>
			<li> There could be more consistency in letter-styling among all your sets? Maybe go with either all caps or regular text and not both; for purposes of emphasis, I'd say also to choose either to use coloring or italics, and not both. </li>
			<li> 
			<li> For the first two images, I think the desktop image quality could be better? </li>
			<li> The text in the first desktop image could probably be grouped as one body to be more legible! I like that you're playing with the positioning of the words to interact with the image, but there are so many different texts within the image that it all gets a bit confusing. (Also it might be difficult to build it in html) </li>
			<li> For your first mobile image, I would either adjust the image to leave more space on top so that the first part of text doesn't all stack up on top of the store sign letters so that it takes a while to find the rest of the quote, or just keep the whole quote in one body!</li>
			<li> Not sure if this was intentional, but in the second mobile image a part of the text covers his eyes. If it wasn't intentional, I think the first part of the quote in white could be shifted up. </li>
