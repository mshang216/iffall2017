		<h1> Critique Notes </h1>
			<h2>Crit #1 with Ashley and Jane:</h2>
				<ul>
				Vibrant vibes and type face good, generates intended feeling<br />
				Images in random placement good, but will probably be difficult to code >>> instead of depicting randomness this way perhaps consider taking in different elements mentioned in lyrics and photocollaging instead? ( Originally I had purposely avoided this because I did not want to be too directly illustrative) <br />
				Color scheme and rectangular shapes: reminds of Spongebob, not super relevant to their actual album cover. <br />
				Bright pink on blue is a little difficult to read <br />
				</ul>

			<h2>Crit #2 with OnYou:</h2>
				<ul>Images: make sure find right compression so that webpage won't take forever to load.
				</ul>
